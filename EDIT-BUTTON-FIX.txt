ðŸ”§ EDIT BUTTON FIX - STEP BY STEP INSTRUCTIONS

ISSUE: Edit button not accessible after starting server

SOLUTION APPLIED:
âœ… Fixed previewResume() function to use server check
âœ… All dashboard functions now redirect to http://localhost:3000
âœ… Created test page to verify functionality

HOW TO TEST THE EDIT BUTTON:

1. START THE SERVER:
   - Double-click: start-3d-resume.bat
   - Wait for "webpack compiled successfully"
   - Server should be running on http://localhost:3000

2. OPEN THE DASHBOARD:
   - Open: FrontEnd/Login/dashboard.html
   - Make sure you're logged in

3. TEST THE EDIT BUTTON:
   - Click "Edit My Resume" 
   - Should show server check dialog
   - If server is running, should redirect to 3D scene

4. VERIFY EDIT FUNCTIONALITY:
   - Open: test-edit-buttons.html (for testing)
   - Click "Check Server Status"
   - Test each button function

WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN:
- Click "Edit My Resume" â†’ Server check â†’ Redirect to http://localhost:3000
- Click "Create New Resume" â†’ Server check â†’ Redirect to http://localhost:3000  
- Click "Preview My Resume" â†’ Server check â†’ Redirect to http://localhost:3000

TROUBLESHOOTING:
- If buttons don't work: Check browser console for errors
- If server check fails: Make sure server is running on port 3000
- If redirect fails: Make sure http://localhost:3000 is accessible

FILES UPDATED:
- dashboard.js: Fixed previewResume() function
- test-edit-buttons.html: Created for testing
- All functions now use startServerAndRedirect() for consistency

NEXT STEPS:
1. Test the dashboard edit button
2. Verify redirect to 3D scene
3. Confirm edit functionality works in 3D environment
