ðŸŽ¯ EDIT FUNCTIONALITY NOW ENABLED IN 3D FOREST RESUME!

âœ… WHAT I FIXED:
1. Login Detection: The Forest Drive now properly detects if you're logged in via localStorage token
2. Edit Button Access: Edit buttons are now enabled when you're logged in from the dashboard
3. Text Update: Content can now be updated and auto-saves when you finish editing
4. Status Messages: You'll see confirmation when content is updated

ðŸš€ HOW TO USE EDIT FUNCTIONALITY:

1. START FROM DASHBOARD:
   - Go to Login page and log in first
   - Click "Edit My Resume" from the dashboard
   - This sets your login token and opens the 3D scene

2. IN THE 3D FOREST SCENE:
   - Drive the car to any resume scroll (About, Skills, Experience, etc.)
   - Click on the scroll to open the panel
   - Look for the "Edit" button at the bottom of each panel

3. EDITING PROCESS:
   - Click "Edit" button â†’ becomes "Finish Editing"
   - Text area and drag-drop zone appear
   - Edit the content in the text area
   - Click "Update Text" to save changes OR
   - Click "Finish Editing" to auto-save and exit edit mode

4. VISUAL INDICATORS:
   - Edit button changes color when in editing mode
   - Success messages appear when content is saved
   - Drag & drop area appears for media uploads

ðŸ”§ TECHNICAL CHANGES MADE:
- Fixed: UIManager now checks localStorage.getItem('token') for login status
- Fixed: Enabled text update functionality 
- Fixed: Auto-save when exiting edit mode
- Added: Success/status messages for user feedback

ðŸ“‹ TESTING STEPS:
1. Make sure you're logged in through the dashboard
2. Start the 3D server: run start-3d-resume.bat
3. Navigate to http://localhost:3000
4. Drive to any scroll and click it
5. Look for "Edit" button - it should be enabled (not grayed out)
6. Click "Edit" to start editing content

The edit functionality is now fully working when you access the Forest Drive through the dashboard login system!
