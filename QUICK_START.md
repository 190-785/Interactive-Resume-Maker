# 🌲 FOREST DRIVE 3D RESUME - QUICK START GUIDE

## 🚀 Simple 3-Step Process

### Step 1: Start the Server
Double-click: **`start-3d-resume.bat`** in the project root folder

### Step 2: Wait for Server
- A command window will open
- Wait for the message "webpack compiled successfully"
- Your browser should automatically open to `http://localhost:8080`

### Step 3: Use Your 3D Resume
- The 3D Forest scene should load automatically
- Keep the command window open while using the application

## 🎮 Alternative Access Methods

### Direct 3D Scene Access:
- URL: `http://localhost:8080`
- (Only works after server is started)

### Dashboard Access:
- File path: `F:\Interavtive_Resume\Interactive-Resume-Maker\FrontEnd\Login\dashboard.html`
- Use this to manage your resume settings

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Keep the server window open** - Closing it stops the 3D scene
2. **Node.js required** - Install from https://nodejs.org/ if not installed
3. **Port 8080** - Make sure no other application is using this port

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "npm not found" error:
- Install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/

### "Port 8080 already in use":
- Close other applications using port 8080
- Or restart your computer

### Server won't start:
- Try running the batch file as Administrator
- Check your antivirus settings

### 3D scene not loading:
- Make sure the server is running (check the command window)
- Try refreshing the browser page
- Clear browser cache if needed

## 🌟 What You Should See

1. **Server starts** - Command window shows webpack messages
2. **Browser opens** - Automatically goes to localhost:8080
3. **3D scene loads** - Interactive forest environment appears
4. **Resume content** - Your resume information in the 3D world
