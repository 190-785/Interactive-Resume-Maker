ðŸ”§ PORT CONFLICT RESOLVED!

PROBLEM: 
- Your Spring Boot backend server runs on port 8080
- Your 3D Forest Resume frontend was trying to use the same port 8080
- This caused the Whitelabel Error Page (Spring Boot's 404 page)

SOLUTION:
- Frontend 3D scene now runs on port 3000
- Backend API server stays on port 8080
- No more conflicts!

QUICK ACCESS:
- 3D Forest Resume: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:8080
- Dashboard: file:///F:/Interavtive_Resume/Interactive-Resume-Maker/FrontEnd/Login/dashboard.html

TO START THE 3D SCENE:
1. Double-click: start-3d-resume.bat
2. Wait for "webpack compiled successfully"
3. Browser opens to http://localhost:3000
4. Enjoy your 3D Forest Resume!

Both servers can now run simultaneously without conflicts.
